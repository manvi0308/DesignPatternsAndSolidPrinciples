	/*
	 * This code violates the Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) because the
	 * Advanced interface combines multiple unrelated functionalities (coloredPrint,
	 * scan, copy) into one interface. As a result:
	 * 
	 * Violation Explanation: The BasicPrinter class does not need functionalities
	 * like coloredPrint, scan, or copy, but it is forced to implement these methods
	 * if it wants to implement Advanced. This creates unnecessary dependency on
	 * methods it doesn't use, which goes against ISP.
	 * 
	 * Why itâ€™s a problem: If, in the future, we add more advanced features (e.g.,
	 * fax or email), every printer class implementing Advanced will be forced to
	 * either implement those features or leave them empty, leading to bloated or
	 * partially implemented interfaces.
